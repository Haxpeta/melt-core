  ;; there are three numbers in the version string

  ;;    melt can be packaged and can run independently. melt now is not
  ;;    compatibal with previous main version.
  ;; -- the second number is the minor version number, when it updates,
  ;;    melt is stable with all branch version. melt can be patched
  ;;    and distributed.
  ;;    melt is compatibal with previous second version.
  ;; -- the third number is the branch version number. Every bug fix or feature
  ;;    added or some procedure updated will update the number.
